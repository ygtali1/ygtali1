# Hi, I'm Ali Yiğit 👋

**Computer Engineering Student @ Ege University | AI & Machine Learning**

I focus on building AI systems from the ground up — from implementing Transformer architecture in PyTorch and training language models from scratch, to developing RAG pipelines and applying deep learning and classical machine learning techniques on real-world problems.
